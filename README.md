- **Multiple Solver Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, and A* search with real-time visualization
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Manual maze solving with keyboard controls
- **Real-time Statistics**: Move counter and timer for manual gameplay
- **Multiple Themes**: Classic, Neon, Dungeon, Forest, and Ocean themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### ðŸŽ¯ Game Modes
- **Manual Play**: Control the player with arrow keys or WASD
- **Auto-Solve**: Watch algorithms solve the maze automatically
- **Adjustable Speed**: Control animation speed for solver visualization

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Features
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion
- **Color-coded Elements**: Different colors for walls, paths, visited cells, and solution
- **Interactive Controls**: Click on adjacent cells to move
- **Real-time Updates**: Live statistics and completion status

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Modern ES6+** JavaScript features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd maze-generator-solver
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## How to Play

### Manual Mode
1. Use **arrow keys** or **WASD** to move the player
2. Click on **adjacent cells** to move
3. Navigate from the **green start** to the **yellow end**
4. Try to complete the maze with the fewest moves and fastest time

### Auto-Solve Mode
1. Select a **solver algorithm** (BFS, DFS, or A*)
2. Adjust the **animation speed** as desired
3. Click **"Auto-Solve Maze"** to watch the algorithm work
4. Observe how different algorithms explore the maze differently

### Maze Generation
1. Choose a **maze size** (11x11 to 41x41)
2. Select a **generation algorithm**:
   - **DFS**: Creates mazes with long corridors
   - **Prim's**: Creates balanced mazes
   - **Kruskal's**: Creates complex mazes with many paths
3. Click **"Generate New Maze"** to create a new puzzle

## Algorithms Explained

### Generation Algorithms

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Uses a stack-based approach
- Creates mazes with long corridors and fewer dead ends
- Good for creating challenging, winding paths

#### Prim's Algorithm
- Uses a minimum spanning tree approach
- Creates more balanced mazes with uniform path distribution
- Good for creating fair, solvable mazes

#### Kruskal's Algorithm
- Uses a union-find data structure
- Creates mazes with many short paths and more complexity
- Good for creating intricate, challenging mazes

### Solver Algorithms

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving deeper
- Guarantees the shortest path to the goal
- Good for finding optimal solutions

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- May not find the shortest path
- Good for exploring maze structure

#### A* Search
- Uses heuristic function to guide search toward the goal
- Combines the benefits of BFS and DFS
- Efficiently finds optimal paths in most cases
